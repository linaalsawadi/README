                  <h5>Damascus ?</h5>
                  <p>
                    It is colloquially known in Syria as aš-Šām (الشَّام) and titled the "City of Jasmine" (مَدِينَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn).Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world. The city had an estimated population of 2,079,000 in 2019.
        
                    In southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Its population in 2004 was estimated to be 2.7 million people.Embedded on the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences a dry climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.
                    
                    Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. Damascus saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. Today, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. <a href="my-city.html">press to continue</a></p>

                    My school life, my school life began in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and I went to kindergarten,
 And I had very good friends. And from then on, I entered elementary school in and I was always superior in my grades. I had many friends in Sudan. They were helpful, benevolent people and I instantly fell in love with them. After completing primary school, we moved to the Arabian Peninsula. I went to middle school there and had a hard time adjusting until I met friends. But then I got used to it. And I studied the seventh and eighth grades, and as usual, I excelled. My life in Arabia was very beautiful. We moved to Hatay in 2016. Our neighbors there were very kind and wonderful. We learned Turkish by talking to them. I practiced my hobbies one by one in Hatay.<a href="resume.html">press to continues</a>

                      The mosque occupies a huge quadrangle 515 by 330 feet (157 by 100 metres) and contains a large open courtyard surrounded by an arcade of arches supported by slender columns. The liwan, or hall of worship, running the length of the south side of the mosque, is divided into three long aisles by rows of columns and arches. A transept with a central octagonal dome, originally wooden, cuts across the aisles at their midpoint. The marble grilles that cover the windows in the south wall are the earliest example of geometric interlace in Islamic architecture. The walls of the mosque were once covered with more than an acre of mosaics depicting a fanciful landscape thought to be the Quʾrānic paradise, but only fragments survive. The mosque was destroyed by Timur in 1401, rebuilt by the Arabs, and damaged by fire in 1893
